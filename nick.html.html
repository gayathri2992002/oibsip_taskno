				About the Legend
			</h1>

			

<p>He was born without arms and legs, and eventually became one of the world’s most sought-after motivational speakers. He has been almost everywhere to inspire people and share his messages of love and determination.
He founded the Life Without Limbs Foundation at only 17 years old.
Despite his physical limitations, he completed his degree with a double major in Accounting and Financial Planning at 21 years old.
He released a motivational short film, entitled "Life's Greater Purpose.”
He was nominated Young Australian of the Year in 2005 for his foundation and inspirational/motivational speaking.
In 2006, he founded his very own company, “Attitude Is Altitude,” which is dedicated to public speaking and evangelism.
His first book, "Life Without Limits: Inspiration for a Ridiculously Good Life" became popular rather quickly, resulting in his invitations to be interviewed on shows such as 20/20 and 60 Minutes.
“The Butterfly Circus,” a film in which he was featured, won first prize at the Method Film Festival, received a Doorstop Film Award, and gave Nick his first “Best Actor” award.
In 2010, “The Butterfly Circus" won the “Best Short Film” Award at the Feel Good Film Festival.
He is happily married, and a new father of a healthy baby boy.
